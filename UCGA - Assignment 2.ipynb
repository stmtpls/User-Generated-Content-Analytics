Cruz has a slight negative sentiment related to trump, while beto is surprisingly related to trump in a more neutral way. Further analysis on a larger sample could shed some more light and explain whether or not the relation is actually negative, and could effect negativly on Cruz\n",

    "3. We can see that Cruz and Beto are both related to health issues in a positive way (0.47 vs 0.5), with beto having a slight more positively relation to it, Cruz might want to relate more to that issue and raise public opinion regarding his relation to it\n",

We can see that in general, there are more mentions of the candidates in big cities then in smaller cities, and this is interesting given the fact that small cities total population is 2 times the population of the big cities we chose. This might mean that people in smaller cities are less involved in politics then in bigger cities, and so the candidates would want to emphasize on bigger cities.\n",
